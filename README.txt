This MATLAB software package is designed to compute the Nonparametric Maximum Likelihood Estimator (NPMLE) for mixture models. It utilizes the Augmented Lagrangian Method in conjunction with the Partial Expectation Maximization approach to perform efficient and accurate estimation.

The primary computational routines are implemented in the files DualALM.m and PEM.m, which serve as the core solvers of the package.

To facilitate usage and demonstrate the functionality, the package also includes the following example scripts:

test_simulation1.m

test_simulation2.m

test_simulation3.m

These scripts provide illustrative use cases and help users understand the application of the solvers in practical simulation scenarios.
